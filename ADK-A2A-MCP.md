## Core Concepts & Technologies 

### Agent Development Kit (ADK)
- Google's framework for building AI agents
- Provides standardized interfaces for agent creation
- Supports multiple LLM backends (Gemini, Vertex AI)
- Built-in support for streaming, multi-turn conversations, and tool integration

### Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol
- **Purpose**: Standardizes runtime communication between AI agents
- **Key Components**:
  - **Agent Cards**: JSON schemas describing agent identity, capabilities, and endpoints
  - **Message Formats**: Standardized `ExecuteTask` requests and responses
  - **Interaction Flows**: Defined patterns for agent-to-agent communication
- **Benefits**: Enables dynamic agent discovery and interoperability

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- **Role**: Acts as a centralized registry and tool provider
- **Functionality**: 
  - Stores and serves Agent Cards as resources
  - Provides tools for agent discovery and selection
  - Enables dynamic tool loading and execution
- **Storage**: Can use file systems, databases, or vector stores

## System Architecture 

### High-Level Architecture

```
User Interface
     ↓
Host/Orchestrator Agent (ADK)
     ↓
MCP Server (Agent Registry + Tools)
     ↓
Remote Agents (A2A Protocol)
     ↓
External Services/APIs
```

### Component Breakdown

#### 1. **Orchestrator Agent**
- Central coordinator built with ADK
- Receives user requests and decomposes them into tasks
- Queries MCP server for appropriate agents
- Manages task execution and result aggregation

#### 2. **MCP Server**
- **Agent Registry**: Stores Agent Cards for discovery
- **Tool Provider**: Exposes specialized tools (database queries, API calls)
- **Resource Management**: Handles agent metadata and capabilities

#### 3. **Remote Agents**
- Specialized agents for specific domains (Airbnb, Weather, etc.)
- Expose A2A-compatible endpoints
- Use MCP tools for external service integration
- Built with various frameworks (LangGraph, CrewAI, etc.)

### Data Flow Example

1. **User Query**: "Find a hotel in LA and check the weather"
2. **Orchestrator**: Decomposes into [hotel_search, weather_check]
3. **MCP Discovery**: Finds Airbnb Agent and Weather Agent
4. **A2A Communication**: Sends tasks to respective agents
5. **Tool Execution**: Agents use MCP tools for external APIs
6. **Result Aggregation**: Orchestrator combines and presents results

```

### Key Implementation Details

#### 1. **Agent Card Definition**
```json
{
  "name": "Airbnb Agent",
  "description": "Helps with searching accommodation",
  "url": "http://localhost:10002/",
  "capabilities": {
    "streaming": true,
    "pushNotifications": true
  },
  "skills": [{
    "id": "airbnb_search",
    "name": "Search airbnb accommodation",
    "examples": ["Find a room in LA, CA, April 15-18, 2 adults"]
  }]
}
```

#### 2. **MCP Server Configuration**
```python
SERVER_CONFIGS = {
    "bnb": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["-y", "@openbnb/mcp-server-airbnb"],
        "transport": "stdio",
    }
}
```

#### 3. **A2A Communication Flow**
```python
# Orchestrator discovers and connects to remote agent
agent_card = await mcp_client.get_agent_card("airbnb")
a2a_client = A2AClient(agent_card.url)

# Send task via A2A protocol
response = await a2a_client.execute_task({
    "query": "Find hotels in LA",
    "session_id": session_id
})
```

#### 4. **Agent Implementation Pattern**
```python
class AirbnbAgent:
    def __init__(self, mcp_tools):
        self.model = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(model="gemini-2.5-flash")
        self.mcp_tools = mcp_tools
        
    async def ainvoke(self, query: str, sessionId: str):
        agent = create_react_agent(
            self.model,
            tools=self.mcp_tools,
            prompt=self.SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION
        )
        return await agent.ainvoke(query, config)
```

## Development Journey: From Concept to Implementation 

### Phase 1: Concept & Design
- **Challenge**: Need for scalable multi-agent systems
- **Solution**: Combine ADK's agent framework with A2A's interoperability
- **Innovation**: Use MCP as both registry and tool provider

### Phase 2: Architecture Design
- **Decision**: Centralized orchestration vs. peer-to-peer
- **Choice**: Hybrid approach with MCP as coordination layer
- **Rationale**: Balance between control and flexibility

### Phase 3: Implementation Challenges
1. **Tool Integration**: Connecting MCP tools with LangGraph agents
2. **Session Management**: Maintaining state across agent boundaries
3. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when agents are unavailable
4. **Dependency Management**: Node.js (npx) requirements for MCP servers

### Phase 4: Framework Integration
